  <b> <h1> My Journey into Tech</h1></b>
   <body><p>Hey, my name is Nicole! I started in tech in highschool making HTML websites for fun. 
      After college, I landed my first big girl job in 2016 working at a medical billing clearinghouse as a Customer Service representative.</p>
   
   <p>In August 2021, I started my first Youtube channel where I showcased my musical talents as well as skills in photography and videography.
      
   In August 2021 I landed a role at Apple Inc. as an Associate Producer. I accepted the offer and moved from the Midwest to California.
   I currently reside in Silicon Valley. </p>

  <p> What I've learned during this journey is that hardwork and having faith in yourself can get you far in life. I now believe there is nothing I can't do. </p>

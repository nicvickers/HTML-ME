  <b> <h1> My Journey into Tech</h1></b>
  <div id = "intro">
   <body><p>Hey, my name is Nicole! I started in tech in highschool making HTML websites for fun. 
      After college, I landed my first big girl job in 2016 working at a medical billing clearinghouse as a Customer Service representative.</p>
   
   <p>In August 2021, I started my first Youtube channel where I showcased my musical talents as well as skills in photography and videography.
      
   In August 2021 I landed a role at Apple Inc. as an Associate Producer. I accepted the offer and moved from the Midwest to California.
   I currently reside in Silicon Valley. </p>

  <p> What I've learned during this journey is that hardwork and having faith in yourself can get you far in life. I now believe there is nothing I can't do. </p>

 <h2>Fave Quotes</h2>
 <p>Quote from Michelle Obama: <q>Success isnt about how your life looks to others. Its about how it feels to you.</q></p>
 <p> Quote from Will Smith: <q>If you're not willing to work hard, let someone else do it. I'd rather be with someone who does a horrible job, but gives 110% than with someone who does a good job and gives 60%.</q></p>
